Download \u00b6 The whole package can be downloaded as a ZIP package, otherwise you can navigate to the the specific drive, hotend or addon page and download files from there. Download Support \u00b6 Big thanks to the users - one example is that only thanks to your donations the Mosquito parts were possible. If you want to support the project or just buy me coffee you can Paypal.me . In a huge part the project exists thatks to Rat Rig - they help me out with screws and nuts but also hotends and boards: Please go and buy something from them Issues \u00b6 Issues, problems, feature requests, requests for compatibility with different printers can be requested in the project's issue tracker . Attributions \u00b6 One does not need a keen eye to see that this design is based on many different designs that are out in the wild - although all the parts here are made from scratch - their authors deserve credit (their work provided inspiration): Rat Rig for making the V-core which is the perfect sandbox for building and modding a 3D Printer pekcitron for the Prusa Bear Upgrade BLV and his amazing BLV mgn cube The following people deserve special credit for their amazing work - making some of the parts, providing guidance, testing parts, keeping me in check. Their input was a huge help so please do me a favor and check out their work: Olof Ogland Simon Davie Jo\u00e3o Barros THANK YOU! Examples \u00b6 For Rat Rig V-core Pro the Easy Mod is required to change the X and Y rail orientation.

A printer can lock to a specific EVA version and update when the change is sigificant enough while the users can follow updates at a faster pace. Universal Front \u00b6 EVA allows you to quickly swap a hotend without fiddling with the belts. Only 6-7 easily accessible screws need to be undone to take the hotend of the carriage to change it or for maintenance purposes. Hotends compatible with universal front are: V6 , Mosquito and Dragon ( Copperhead and others are incoming). Drives \u00b6 EVA supports different extrusion options - Titan , BMG (and BMG-M) , Orbiter are mounted on the top and are compatible with all available hotends. Backs \u00b6 EVA can be mounted on printers with CoreXY , Cartesian and IDEX motion systems. MGN carriages \u00b6 EVA can be mounted on MGN12C and MGN12H carriages. MGN15C support was dropped in 2.4.0. Bed probing \u00b6 EVA comes with a defined place for 2 point probe mounting. That enables it to handle many probing solutions.

Infill should not be less than 20% rectilinear. Most of the parts can be printed with 0.3 layer height but 0.2 is the safe bet. Printing orientation \u00b6 The parts are not oriented in the print orientation. I am currently unavailable to maintain that but the rule is: find a big flat face and set it on the bed. Supports \u00b6 Unless specified the parts require no supports . If your print orientation required supports then you oriented the part wrong :) Handling hex nuts \u00b6 To properly insert a hex nut into a printed part you need to take a short screw, thread it through the hole, put the nut in, drive the nut untill it's properly sitting in it's place and finally remove the short screw. This is very important and will allow for the nut not to bind in the screw threads when you are mid-way through your assembly - when a nut binds the two parts are usually garbage and need to be reprinted. Pokey Pokey hole technique \u00b6 When looking at the files or when slicing you will find that the holes are not there that is by design and while I know there are many techiques for achieving proper mid-air holes I am not able to consume the amount of work required to implement that for every single hole or sometimes there's not enough room for that. There are 0.2 - 0.3 layers covering the holes to \"trick\" the slicer into thinking there is a bridge to be made. After printing you need to either drill, poke with a screw driver, allen key or even force the screw throuh that layer - all of the above works (drill being the fastest obviously). You can see the blue spots (bridges) around the belt teeth are covering the holes fully.","title":"Printing"},{"location":"printing/#printing-orientation","text":"The parts are not oriented in the print orientation.

Titan served us well, especially in the early days as an alternative for the lousy extruders printers came with. Deprectaion means that this is the last release this variant got an update, next time it will be marked as obsolete . This means that it will stop receiving upgrades but will forever be available in the 2.4.0 version in it's submodule repository . Description \u00b6 EVA / Titan is the oldest and in my opinion one of the best variants the one quite closest to my heart as it was the original and only extruder option for the first Easy-Mod - later was moved to a separate project which EVA become Since EVA 2.0.0 it does not require a unique front part, just a top (like BMG) which makes it not only easier to assemble but also to maintain. One can opt to use the press fit part if is lacking a groove mount adapter. There is a PTFE tube going from the Titan to the hotend so it's not as \"direct\" as one could imagine but still the print quality is excellent (or at least not impeded by the carriage). used by: 1.30 % (based on 2021-11 survey) EVA spec: 2.4.0 authors: pkucmus official Custom Titan Tension Arm The BOM contains my remix of the E3D Titan Flex Upgrade thing which improves the Titan filament path greatly.
